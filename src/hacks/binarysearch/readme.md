## Binary Search
This repository contains some famous variations of binary search. Solving these variations will help you to recognize problems that can be solved using binary search algorithm. 

### Pattern: 
> If input is **sorted** then it is only natural that the optimal solution is O(log(n)) . 
> So, don't think twice to apply binary search.
> However a plain binary solution may not work for all searching problems.
> In such scenario we've to analyze the problem and figure out how we can be benefited from binary search.
