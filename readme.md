### Patterns
> If you understand this generic patterns, you can use them as a template to solve a myriad of other problems with slight variations.

| Description | DSA |
| --- | --- |
| If input array is sorted then | Binary search / Two pointers |
| If asked for all permutations/subsets then | Backtracking |
| If given a tree then | DFS / BFS |
| If given a graph then | DFS / BFS |
| If given a linked list then | Two pointers
|
| If recursion is banned then | Stack
|
| If must solve in-place then | Swap corresponding valuesStore one or more different values in the same pointer |
| If asked for maximum/minimum subarray/subset/options then | Dynamic programming |
| If asked for top/least K items then
| Heap
|
| If asked for common strings then | Map / Trie
|
| Else | Map/Set for O(1) time &amp; O(n) spaceSort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space
